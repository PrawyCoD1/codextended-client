# Call of Duty Extended [Client]

Call of Duty Extended Client is a modification of the Call of Duty 1 client game. It supports patch 1.1.
Goal of this project is to fix bugs from the original 1.1 client, add features that are present in newer, but less popular patches, and also to add some of our own unique features (e.g. Discord RPC, CoD 4-like UI elements).

## Changes/additions

- servername whitelist (no more [] symbols, unnamed servers and spaces in server name)
- fix for invalid CD-Key when using fs_game / mods
- cURL (HTTP/fast) download
- CoD 4-like scoreboard & loading screen
- more bugfixes, etc.
