# Call of Duty Extended [Client]

CoDExtended Client, also known as CoD 1.1x, is a client-side modification (mod for players) for Call of Duty 1 1.1.
Goal of this project is to fix bugs from the original client, add features that are present in newer, but less popular patches, and also to add some of our own unique features (e.g. Discord RPC, CoD 4-like UI elements).

## Changes/additions

- server list name cleanup (removed invalid characters which pushed servers to top)
- fixed  "invalid CD-Key" when using fs_game / mods
- cURL (HTTP/fast) download
- new UI elements (cg_xui_scoreboard, cg_xui_connect, cg_xui_fps)
- Discord Rich Presence
- unlocked FOV
- bugfixes

## Notice

The public version does not include automatic updates or anticheat, but also prevents you from joining certain servers which enforce official 1.1x.

## Usage

Compile with Visual Studio<br>
Rename old mss32.dll to miles32.dll<br>
Copy newly compiled DLL to game directory and rename it to mss32.dll<br>
